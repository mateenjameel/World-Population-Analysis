## Project Background
This project was initiated during my internship at Prodigi Infotech, where I was tasked with performing a comprehensive data analysis on global population trends. The goal was to gain valuable insights into demographic patterns and changes over time.

# World Population Analysis

## Overview
World Population Analysis is a Python project that explores global demographic data to gain insights into population trends. The project includes data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling for understanding how populations have changed over the years.

## Features
- Visualize population trends for different countries and regions.
- Analyze correlations and patterns in demographic data.
- Predict future population using linear regression modeling.
- Compare population growth rates between countries.

## Usage
1. **Download the Dataset:** [World_Population.csv](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)
2. **Explore the Jupyter Notebooks:** Use Jupyter Notebooks to interact with and analyze the provided dataset.
3. **Contribute:** Feel free to contribute to the project by suggesting improvements, adding new features, or fixing issues.
